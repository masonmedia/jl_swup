                                <p><span class="font-weight-bold">1.1 What: </span>Jaxx Liberty is non-custodial blockchain software for people. Its tools help users interact with third-party blockchain coins, tokens, and cryptocurrencies (together, <em>"digital assets"</em>), and organize information about them.</p>
                                <div id="b-2"></div>
                                <p>Software should help protect human rights, like privacy. Jaxx Liberty is designed to respect your privacy. We avoid collecting personal information. We have no access to your 12-word <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki" target="_blank"><span class="orange">mnemonic phrase</span></a> or the private keys derived from it. That means we can't help recover them if lost, so install your mnemonic phrase on a second device. At the very least, write it down.</p>
                                <!--1.2-->
                                <p><span class="font-weight-bold">1.2 How: </span>You can use Jaxx Liberty software, services, and support at no charge, as long as you abide by these terms. You're free to terminate the agreement by stopping to use Jaxx Liberty; we're free to stop providing it.</p>
                                <div id="b-3"></div>
                                <p>Our agreement doesn't apply to third-party information, including the news headlines Jaxx Liberty integrates, market rates and data we include, and external services to which we help you connect. Nor does this agreement cover your relationship with the digital assets with which Jaxx Liberty lets you interact -- but which Decentral neither created nor can influence. Third parties apply their own terms and policies. Review them.</p>
                                <!--1.3-->
                                <p><span class="font-weight-bold">1.3 Who: </span>We're Decentral Inc. (<a href="https://decentral.ca" target="_blank"><span class="orange">decentral.ca</span></a>), a Canadian corporation (<a href="mailto:info@jaxx.io"><span class="orange">info@jaxx.io</span></a>; P.O. Box P. O. Box 292, Station B, Toronto ON, M5T 2W2), which makes and maintains the Jaxx Liberty software, and can assign it only to someone who takes over the software or our company.</p>
                                <p>You're at least 18 years old, at least the age of majority where you reside, and control or own the device running Jaxx Liberty. No Canadian or U.S. governments has embargoed, designated as "terrorist supporting", or prohibited or restricted you or the place you live. You can't assign the agreement to anyone.</p>
                                <p>This agreement is between you and us: it binds no one else. The app store or other download intermediary where you obtained Jaxx Liberty does have the right to enforce this agreement's terms as a third-party beneficiary. But no download intermediary has any responsibility for Jaxx Liberty -- not its content, not its maintenance or support, not product liability or consumer law or regulatory compliance, not intellectual property infringement.</p>

                                <p><span class="font-weight-bold">2.1 Pro-privacy approach: </span>The best way to respect your privacy is to avoid snooping. Our pro-privacy stance requires us to avoid collecting or exposing, “personal information”: anything that could identify you, whether on its own or when combined with other information. Your mnemonic phrase is stored, and your private keys derived, on your device only. We can’t access them. You can always take them elsewhere. You’re never locked into Jaxx Liberty.</p>
                                <p>Decentral is exposed to the limited personal information from Jaxx Liberty users described below. But we: avoid retaining personal information we’re exposed to; minimize the identifiers we have to generate; and will provide and erase any holdings on request: <a href="mailto:legal@jaxx.io"><span class="orange">legal@jaxx.io</span></a>. We bind our staff and seek to bind <a href="https://jaxx.io/thirdparties-current.html"><span class="orange">every relevant contractor</span></a> to confidentiality agreements. We use only encrypted connections between our own servers, and insist on them with third-party servers.</p>

                                <!--2.2-->
                                <p><span class="font-weight-bold">2.2. Limiting what we collect: </span>Jaxx Liberty has no accounts, because your mnemonic phrase and private keys are none of our business. But Jaxx Liberty does (i) undertake pseudonymous metrics collection; (ii) provide user support; (iii) derive a persistent “Unity” blockchain address from your mnemonic, and allow you to pair it with an optional “myJAXX” display name and email address.</p>
                                <div id="p-2"></div>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><p>Pseudonymous metrics are generated by collecting four types of information, and retaining them – linked together – until the end of the calendar month. The four types of information are: when you first installed Jaxx Liberty on your device; the operating system you’re running it on; the country to which we think your Internet Protocol address resolves; and when you clicked on each Jaxx Liberty module. We retain these data till the end of each calendar month, aggregate them to generate monthly statistics, then discard them completely. They’re never retained for more than 31 days.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>User support is run separately from the Jaxx Liberty systems, therefore decoupled from pseudonymous metrics. Providing personal information within user support – like an email address – exposes it to a <a href="https://jaxx.io/thirdparties-current.html"><span class="orange">third party bound contractually to respect your privacy.</span></a></p></li>
                                    <li><p>Unity address, a persistent pseudonym, is decoupled from your Internet Protocol address, blockchain activity, and device information. We can’t deduce your mnemonic phrase from it, don’t have information about whose it is, don’t expose it outside our systems, and don’t currently collect it. But if you opt in to myJAXX by entering a display name and email address – giving us a way to provide you with updates and interact with your display name for future in-app gamification – then we link your Unity address with these, which we retain. You can always withdraw consent for email subscriptions by clicking on the link at the bottom of the email.</p></li>

Minimizing what we retain: </span> Using the Internet means <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/" target="_blank"><span class="orange">leaking personal information.</span></a> When your Jaxx Liberty establishes an encrypted connection to our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/"><span class="orange">AWS-hosted</span></a> virtual servers, your: Internet Protocol address, device type, operating system language, and monthly-discarded client information (install date, operating system, perceived country, module clicks) are logged.</p>
                                <p>We parse each log; increment relevant non-personal statistics counters, including within monthly-discarded client information; and delete the raw log within 24 hours. But there are three circumstances where we’re required to go beyond that:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><p>We’re not able to offer Jaxx Liberty in every region, so we first check whether your IP address is associated with somewhere we can’t offer service. It’s an inexact science.</p></li>

                                    <li><p>We’re not allowed to relay transactions if they include blockchain addresses designated by lawful authorities, so we check each transaction against mandated blocklists.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>We may have been legally compelled to preserve the log. Where we can, we’ll say when.</p></li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>We don’t provide the limited personal information we do have to anyone unless legally compelled and, to the extent we’re allowed and it’s possible, we notify the affected parties.</p>

                                <p><span class="font-weight-bold">2.4. App permissions: </span>Jaxx Liberty’s mobile editions seek camera permissions. This is to read a QR code, and store it on-device, in order to pair another Jaxx Liberty instance or scan a blockchain address. Jaxx Liberty uses those permissions carefully: it uses the camera only for those purposes and only at your prompting, and never sends anything off-device.</p>

                                <p>a) We can't recover your mnemonic phrase. We have no access to it. If you don't install it on a second device, or keep a physical copy in a safe place, you may lose access to your digital assets forever. Don't do that.</p>
                                <p>b) Decentral isn't liable for any loss or damage that result from providing you with Jaxx Liberty software, services, and support. Nor shall our liability to you exceed, under any circumstances, the greater of the Canadian dollar value of 0.01 bitcoins, and C$50.</p>
                                <div id="ob-2"></div>
                                <p>c) You indemnify Decentral against any claims, damages, losses, and legal fees incurred due to your use of Jaxx Liberty, including support services. If someone sues us about what you do, you pay.</p>
                                <!--3.2-->
                                <p><span class="font-weight-bold">3.2. Act Prudently: </span>Decentral doesn't create, and has no control over, digital assets you interact with through Jaxx Liberty -- so it's up to you to interact with them prudently by doing these three things.</p>
                                <p>a) Learn the basics about digital assets you're considering interacting with. Search for them online. Vet them carefully. Find someone who knows more; ask them.</p>
