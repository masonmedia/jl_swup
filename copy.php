You can do this easily by going to Global Settings -> Security ->Backup Wallet wizard. The wizard will verify your backup by asking you to input it again to validate. By backing up your mnemonic , you can restore your wallet any time by regenerating a new wallet in Jaxx Liberty. Why is this important? What if  you lose your device, or the system is corrupted or you want to sync your wallet to a new device -- what do you do? Simply choose pair/restore wallet and input your 12-word backup phrase (mnemonic) and let Jaxx Liberty do the rest.";

$securityDevOpsTitle11 = "Set a password to fully encrypt the wallet.";
$securityDevOpsDesc11 = "We strongly recommend setting up a password to further enhance security (consider a password as a 2FA for your wallet). As mentioned earlier, setting a password enables Jaxx Liberty to fully encrypt the wallet and minimize exposure. You will only be asked to input a password before critical operations such as send, view backup phrase or pair/restore wallet.";

$securityDevOpsTitle12 = "Be careful when viewing sensitive information.";

However, be mindful when are displaying this sensitive data.  Whoever knows your 12-word backup phrase (mnemonic) can control your entire wallet, regardless if you set a password to encrypt the wallet or not. A malicious user can simply restore your wallet in another device and transfer out all of your funds. However, if a malicious user knows your password, he/she still needs to access your device in order to get access to your wallet.";

$securityDevOpsTitle13 = "Secure the environment that Jaxx Liberty is running on.";
$securityDevOpsDesc13 = "No wallet can be secured if the operating system it is running on is compromised. For example, if a malware infects your system and gains capability of logging keypad, capturing screens or modifying data in the clipboard, no in-wallet security features will be sufficient to stop user from losing funds. Update your operating system and browser often with latest security patches, do not install unknown softwares and be vigilant about latest vulnerability trends.";

$securityDevOpsTitle14 = "Always double-check receiving addresses.";
$securityDevOpsDesc14 = "There are more and more malwares that temper receiving addresses. These malwares target clipboard, which is an unprotected area of memory (for conveniently sharing data between programs), and generally outside of a wallet’s control. Therefore, it is important to  double-check receiving addresses especially after copy and paste it. Check at least the starting and ending characters (to avoid incomplete copies), but the more the better (Malware can be sophisticated and generate similar addresses on the fly).";
